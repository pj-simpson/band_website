## SOA Music Artist Portfolio
A React front-end and Django REST backend with an opinionated structure for a musical artist's portfolio/CMS site. 

## Motivation
I wanted to learn how to build an application which was a 'component' based Javascript front-end consuming a REST API backend, as this seems to have become THE dominant style in python web development over the last few years.

## Update
I have had this deployed on a Digital Ocean droplet and being used as the primary site for my brother's musical project for a while now. After careful consideration, I am currently rebuilding a version of this as a monolith!
